In contrast to static models which use the same computation graph for all instances, adaptive networks can dynamically adjust their structure conditioned on each input. While existing research on adaptive inference mainly focuses on designing more advanced architectures, this paper investigates how to train such networks more effectively. Specifically, we consider a typical adaptive deep network with multiple intermediate classifiers. We present three techniques to improve its training efficiency from two aspects:\n1) a Gradient Equilibrium algorithm to resolve the conflict of learning of different classifiers; 2) an Inline Subnetwork Collaboration approach and a One-for-all Knowledge Distillation algorithm to enhance the collaboration among classifiers.\nOn multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet), we show that the proposed approach consistently leads to further improved efficiency on top of stateof-the-art adaptive deep networks.","tags":null,"title":"Improved Techniques for Training Adaptive Deep Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujun Chen","Xian Yang","Qingwei Lin","Hongyu Zhang","Feng Gao","Zhangwei Xu","Yingnong Dang","Dongmei Zhang","Hang Dong","Yong Xu","**Hao Li**","Yu Kang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1c004f6328bc73ff24d70477b6723ed","permalink":"https://cpsxhao.github.io/publication/chen-2019-outage/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2019-outage/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid growth of cloud service systems and their increasing complexity, service failures become unavoidable. Outages, which are critical service failures, could dramatically degrade system availability and impact user experience. To minimize service downtime and ensure high system availability, we develop an intelligent outage management approach, called AirAlert, which can forecast the occurrence of outages before they actually happen and diagnose the root cause after they indeed occur. AirAlert works as a global watcher for the entire cloud system which collects all alerting signals, detects dependency among signals and proactively predicts outages happened anywhere in the whole cloud system. We analyze the relationships between outages and alerting signals by leveraging Bayesian network and predict outages using a robust gradient boosting tree based classification method. The proposed outage management approach is evaluated using the outage dataset collected from a Microsoft cloud system and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","tags":null,"title":"Outage Prediction and Diagnosis for Cloud Service Systems","type":"publication"}]
